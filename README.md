# Bank Loan Summary Dashboard – Excel Project

## Project Overview
This project presents a comprehensive and interactive Excel dashboard designed to monitor and assess a bank's lending activities and portfolio performance.  
It provides data-driven insights into loan-related metrics, tracks trends over time, and categorizes loans into Good Loans and Bad Loans to evaluate portfolio health.

The dashboard is divided into three key sections:  
1. **Summary Dashboard** – Key KPIs and loan status breakdown  
2. **Overview Dashboard** – Visual trends and distribution charts  
3. **Details Dashboard** – Complete data view for in-depth analysis

## Problem Statement
The bank aims to:
- Track total loan applications, funded amounts, amounts received, interest rates, and debt-to-income ratios.
- Monitor **Month-to-Date (MTD)** and **Month-over-Month (MoM)** changes for all metrics.
- Categorize loans into **Good Loans** (`Fully Paid`, `Current`) and **Bad Loans** (`Charged Off`).
- Analyze loans by status, region, term, employment length, loan purpose, and home ownership.
- Provide a detailed, user-friendly interface for accessing complete loan portfolio data.
